# BKM Engine Examples

This directory contains example scripts demonstrating the BKM Engine capabilities.

## Quick Start Examples

- `quick_start.py` - Minimal example to verify installation
- `gpu_performance_demo.py` - Demonstrate GPU acceleration benefits
- `custom_initial_condition.py` - How to use custom initial conditions
- `convergence_study.py` - Grid refinement study
- `reproduction_paper_figure.py` - Reproduce key figures from the paper

## Running Examples

All examples can be run directly:
```bash
python quick_start.py
python gpu_performance_demo.py --gpu

## Educational vs Production

For educational/teaching demos, see `educational/` subdirectory.
These examples use the production GPU engine for research-quality simulations.
